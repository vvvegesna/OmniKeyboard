Our app is designed to detect and list XML files located in the app's documents directory. The simulator does have a documents directory for each app, however it is not a part of Xcode's project structure, and the location differs from system to system. Because of this, in order to verify this feature, you'll need to put any files into the correct location yourself. One file has been included for you, named "ABC.xml". To locate the correct folder to place it, run the app from Xcode. A debug message will print the documents directory the simulator is using. To easily navigate to this folder, you can copy the text, open Finder, and wile the Finder window has focus, press "Command + Shift + G" to open the go-to dialog. Paste the URL you copied and press "Go" to be taken directly to the correct folder. You can place any XML files here. Note that non-XML files will not be listed in the app at all.
